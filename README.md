# Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
The task involved classifying Iris flowers into three species setosa, versicolor and virginica based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
# Methodology:
1) Imported necessary packages and libraries for the iris dataset.
2) Preprocessed the data such as handling duplicate, missing values etc. and visualised the target variable through count plot and continuous variables such as petallength, petalwidth, sepallength and sepalwidth through box plot.
3) Applied correlation analysis and pair plot to understand the relationships between the variables.
4) Converted the target variable to numerical form for easy analysis and scaled the continuous variables through min max scaling.
5) Used Decision Tree algorithm to fit the model and achieved an accuracy of more than 95%.
6) Visualised the decision tree through plot_tree package from Scikit-learn library.
# Task 2: Unemployment Analysis using Python
The task involved analysing unemployment in India during the pandemic from 2019 to 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse affect on global economy. By analysing the unemployment data, we can gain valuable insights about the economic difficulties faced by the people of different states of India for both rural and urban areas.
# Key Findings:
1) Tripura recorded the highest unemployment rate with an average of approximately 28%.
2) Meghalaya being the only region whose unemployment rate is approximately 5% during the pandemic.
3) During Covid-19, Urban area witnessed more rates of unemployment than Rural area.
4) Before the pandemic in 2019, average unemployment rate was below 10% from May to Dec whereas during the pandemic in 2020, unemployment rate increased from 11% to 25% from 
   March to May and then it is decreased to 12% during the month of June.
# Task 3: Sales Prediction
The task involved predicting sales based on advertising spend on TV, Radio and Newspaper using advertising dataset.
# Methodology:
1) Imported necessary packages and libraries for the advertising dataset.
2) Preprocessed the data such as handling duplicate, missing values etc. and visualised the features through histogram.
3) Applied correlation analysis through heatmap to understand the relationships between the variables and scaled the continuous variables through min max scaling.
4) Used Linear Regression Algorithm to fit the model and achieved a R2 score of approximately 90%.
5) Applied ensemble techniques such as Random Forest to improve the accuracy of the model and achieved a R2 score of more than 95%.
6) Visualised Actual vs Predicted sales through Distribution Plot.
